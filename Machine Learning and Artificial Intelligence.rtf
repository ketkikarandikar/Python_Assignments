### Basic Concepts\par
\b 1. **What is Machine Learning?**\par
\b0    - **Answer:** Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention.\par
\par
\b 2. **What are the different types of Machine Learning?**\par
\b0    - **Answer:** The main types are:\par
     - **Supervised Learning:** The model is trained on labeled data.\par
     - **Unsupervised Learning:** The model works with unlabeled data to find patterns.\par
     - **Reinforcement Learning:** The model learns by receiving rewards or penalties based on its actions.\par
\par
\b 3. **What is overfitting, and how can you prevent it?**\par
\b0    - **Answer:** Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, capturing noise instead of the underlying pattern. You can prevent it by:\par
     - Using simpler models\par
     - Applying regularization techniques\par
     - Using cross-validation\par
     - Pruning decision trees\par
\par
### Algorithms and Techniques\par
\par
\b 4. **What is the difference between classification and regression?**\par
